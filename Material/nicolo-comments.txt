Hi Tony,

looks good in general! Some suggestions below

My comments on the actual poster content:

1) Overall, the poster looks "top-heavy" to me: the introduction and the
description of the current systems take up more than half of the page, 
the actual "DoDM" only show up around 2/3rds of the length. Maybe shrink
the product descriptions and enlarge the "DoDM"?
2) In my opinion,  the "Interactions of the system with users and
external components" could deserve their own box separate from "Metadata
management", your call
3) I had an idea about one additional box, something like "Managing
shares" of limited resources like storage space and bandwidth (it's
implicitly part of "Data-volume" and "Throughput", does it deserve it's
own box? Again your call)
4) In the conclusion, it's not very clear to me how you plan to make use
of the DoDM in actual design of future products...

Minor typos and comments:
* in the Author list, you are listed as 'name surname' but all ATLAS
people are listed as 'surname name'.
* PhEDEx box, Rucio box, Reliability box, Network structure box:
"monte-carlo"-->"Monte Carlo" (the simulation method really takes the
name from the city with the casino  )
*ASO box: "It's"-->"Its"
* ASO box: I think it's strange to put the total rate for AAA and PhEDEx
only in the ASO box for comparison. For me it makes more sense to put a
separate sentence in each box
*AAA box: there's an asterisk for a note with no note attached
*AAA box: the name of the project is "Any Data, Anytime, Anywhere"
* Rucio box: "meta-data"-->"metadata"
* Rucio box: "has client server and daemons architecture"-->"has a
client server and daemons architecture"
* Rucio box: why is a detailed paragraph on architecture only included
for Rucio?
* FAX box: "all of the ATLAS analysis job"-->"all of the ATLAS analysis
jobs"
* FAX box: the picture is almost unreadable even at full zoom
* Latency box: capitalize "minimize"-->"Minimize"
