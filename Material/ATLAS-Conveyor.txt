The conveyor is the transfer management component of Rucio. The conveyor is designed for ATLAS Run-2 nominal throughput at 2 million file transfers per day. It's purpose is manyfold:

0. keep consistent state and history of globally distributed transfers
1. translate transfer and stage-in requests into actual requests understood by a transfertool, e.g., FTS3
2. group requests where sensible, e.g., with the same source and destination, or belonging to the same replication rule
3. divide requests into separate activity shares, e.g., for Tier-0 or Monte Carlo Production
4. submit these requests to a transfertool as a transfer job
5. receive transfer job data from an asynchronous message broker
6. poll the detailed data of recently terminated jobs from the transfertool
7. poll the status, and potentially detailed data if terminated, of lingering requests

Each step is implemented asynchronously as a separate stateless services. The services orchestrate themselves only via the single shared backend database. Each service is guaranteed to only work on a subset of the requests, such that there is no overlap, competition, or potential lock-out.
